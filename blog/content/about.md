Hey there, my name is **John Novak** and this is my personal blog where I keep
a diary of my various ~~mis~~adventures that roughly fall into the
"recreational programming" category. If you really need to further satisfy
your curiosity about my person, try [this post](/2016/02/21/the-beginning/),
or snoop around on [my website](https://www.johnnovak.net/).

Apart from coding, I also like to write [music](https://music.johnnovak.net/),
mess around with [3D art](https://www.artstation.com/johnnovak), and do
[photography](https://photo.johnnovak.net/).

I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnovak1979) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/johnnovak/), and I have a
[website](http://www.johnnovak.net/) too with links to all the stuff I do and
am interested in.

If you feel the need to contact me, drop me a message at
[contact@johnnovak.net](mailto:contact@johnnovak.net)
